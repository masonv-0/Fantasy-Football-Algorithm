This was the first version of my fantasy football algorithm, using a JSON with stats stored inside to predict a given player's fantasy points. See Fantasy Football Algorithm 2.0 for the much improved version.

Google Spreadsheet with tests comparing my algorithm to the ESPN projections: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipsFFUiD658ceujtopdVjDS5leefzvaOPOAFlgdw9ys/edit?gid=0#gid=0
This spreadsheet is updated whenever I have time, so it may not be completely accurate all the time. I also could not find a way to access ESPN's projections for previous weeks, so for every week before I started testing (Week 6), I don't have complete comparisons.
